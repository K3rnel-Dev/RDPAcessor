# ‚öôÔ∏è About

> **A simple example** of a reworked previous project, allowing you to create a user on the end system, enable its groups of remote users and thereby send data to a telegram bot, with data inside: IP address, username and password from the created user, as well as the current RAM memory.
The project has a builder that allows you to automate the assembly of a malicious file, with various conditional interesting functions that will be included in the final compilation optionally at the request of the user himself

- üñ•Ô∏è **Anti-Analysis**: Anti-Debug/VM/Process.
- üî• **Self-Removal (Melting)**: Removes itself from the disk after execution.
- ‚öîÔ∏è **Anti-AnyRun(Working only WIN-7)**: Prevents execute on anyrun systems.
- üì∑ **Mutex**: Creates a stub in the registry to prevent repeated execution on the same system.
- üîì **RunAsAdmin**: A special function that initiates launch on behalf of the administrator - since creating a user and adding it requires administrator rights.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Conditional Compilation**: Allows the builder to include only the features and options chosen by the user, making the final build more streamlined.
- üîí **Custom Renaming and Obfuscation**: Includes customizable renaming of functions and string encryption to make the code less readable and harder to analyze.
